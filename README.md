# Computational Geometry Course exercises
#### üèõÔ∏è Imparted in Universidad Rey Juan Carlos during 2022 for the Math degree.
Implementtions in R of some clasic geometrical problems used to solve some exercised propose during the course.

Some of the algorithms implemented include:
* Quick and slow sorting algorthms graphic comparison. (Included in [Exercise 4](https://github.com/Gooonzalo/URJC-Computational-Geometry-Course/blob/master/Exercise%204%20-%20Quick%20sort%20algorithms.R))
* Convex hull calculation. ([Exercise 7](https://github.com/Gooonzalo/URJC-Computational-Geometry-Course/blob/master/Exercise%207%20-%20Convex%20hull.R))
* Polygon triangulations. ([Exercise 9](https://github.com/Gooonzalo/URJC-Computational-Geometry-Course/blob/master/Exercise%208%20-%20Min%20circles.R))
* Affine transformations in the plane ([Exercise 5](https://github.com/Gooonzalo/URJC-Computational-Geometry-Course/blob/master/Exercise%205%20-%20Affine%20transformations.R))
* Smallest circle containing a given set of points. ([Exercise 8](https://github.com/Gooonzalo/URJC-Computational-Geometry-Course/blob/master/Exercise%208%20-%20Min%20circles.R))
* Algorthim to generate random polygons. (Included in [Exercise 9](https://github.com/Gooonzalo/URJC-Computational-Geometry-Course/blob/master/Exercise%208%20-%20Min%20circles.R))
